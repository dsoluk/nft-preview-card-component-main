## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Advanced Selector ( ~ )
- Interactive (hover)
- image handling (multiply)

### What I learned

For me, the interactivity for the equilibrium image was a real challenge for me. I was very comfortable and blasted through the main card but just couldn't figure out the image changes for the hover interaction. I worked through it on my own for a day then started looking at other solutions but I struggled with some of the code (::before, pointer,...). Eventually a solution using an advanced selector and the multiply command made sense and I developed around that.

### Continued development

Need to spend some time on pseudo elements (e.g. ::before) and working with images. Keen to get on with intergrating some JavaScript too. So much to learn.

### Useful resources

Worked mostly from MDN and W3 school articles.

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to acknowledge Carlton Mpofu who's solution was extremely helpful in making sense of the hover interaction of the equilibrium image. I tried for a day to get my own solution but struggled mightily. Then looked at several other solutions which I couldn't wrap my head around but Carlton's made sence. In addition, the feedback by Grace was very helpful.
